<p>Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-shares-close-up-8-for-yet-another-record-high-2020-07-10">market capitalization</a>, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/netflix-tops-200-million-subscribers-but-faces-growing-challenge-from-disney-plus/">January 2021</a>.</p>
<p> I have performing some analyses, and I believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. </p>
<p>As evidence of this,  I found the information that. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively.</p>
